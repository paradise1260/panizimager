# panizimager

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of panizimager is to work with images. For now, it only has a function called rotate_image. This function rotates an image counter-clockwise for a given number of times. You should pass a loaded image via imager library to the function. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of panizimager from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("paradise1260/panizimager")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(panizimager)
library(imager)
mandrill <- load.image('../mandrill.png')
plot(mandrill)
plot(rotate_image(mandrill, 3))
```
